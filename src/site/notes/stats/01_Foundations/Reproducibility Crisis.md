## Definition

> [!abstract] Core Statement
> The **Reproducibility Crisis** refers to the widespread ==failure of scientific studies to replicate== when repeated by independent researchers.

---

## Key Statistics

- Psychology: Only ~40% of studies replicated (Open Science Collaboration, 2015)
- Cancer biology: 10-25% replication rate
- Economics: ~60% rate

## Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **P-hacking** | Searching for significant results |
| **HARKing** | Hypothesizing After Results Known |
| **Publication bias** | Only positive results published |
| **Small samples** | Low power, inflated effects |
| **Flexibility** | "Researcher degrees of freedom" |

---

## Solutions

| Solution | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Pre-registration** | Lock hypotheses before data |
| **Power analysis** | Adequate sample sizes |
| **Share data/code** | Open science |
| **Registered reports** | Peer review before results |
| **Multi-lab replications** | Independent verification |
