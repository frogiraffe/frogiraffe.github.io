## Impact on Data Science

| Problem | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Model evaluation** | "Obviously that feature was important" |
| **A/B test review** | Variant B "clearly" better in hindsight |
| **Incident analysis** | "We should have seen the crash coming" |

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Pre-registration** — Document predictions before seeing results
2. **Prediction markets** — Track forecasts formally
3. **Blind analysis** — Analyze without knowing ground truth first
4. **Devil's advocate** — Argue the opposite case
