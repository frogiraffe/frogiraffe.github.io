## Definition

> [!abstract] Core Statement
> The **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off** is the dilemma between ==trying new actions== (exploration) to gather information and ==using known good actions== (exploitation) to maximize reward.

> [!tip] Intuition (ELI5): The Restaurant Dilemma
> Do you go to your favorite restaurant (exploit) or try a new one that might be even better (explore)?

## The Trade-off

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Pure Exploitation** | Max short-term reward | Miss better options |
| **Pure Exploration** | Learn everything | Waste time on bad options |
| **Balance** | Optimal long-term | Requires careful tuning |

---

## Solutions

| Algorithm | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **ε-greedy** | Explore randomly ε% of time |
| **UCB** | Explore uncertain options |
| **[[stats/04_Supervised_Learning/Thompson Sampling\|Thompson Sampling]]** | Bayesian uncertainty |
| **Annealing** | Decrease exploration over time |

```python
import numpy as np

def epsilon_greedy(Q_values, epsilon=0.1):
    if np.random.random() < epsilon:
        return np.random.randint(len(Q_values))  # Explore
    else:
        return np.argmax(Q_values)  # Exploit
```

## Applications

| Domain | Explore | Exploit |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **A/B Testing** | Try new variants | Use best variant |
| **Recommendations** | Show new items | Show popular items |
| **Clinical Trials** | Test new treatments | Use proven treatments |
