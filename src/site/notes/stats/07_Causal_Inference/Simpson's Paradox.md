## Definition

> [!abstract] Overview
> **Simpson's Paradox** is a phenomenon in probability and statistics, in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined.

## Example
A treatment appears effective when looking at men and women separately, but appears harmful when looking at the entire population combined, often due to a confounding variable like severity of the case.
