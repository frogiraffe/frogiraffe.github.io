## Definition

> [!abstract] Overview
> **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)** are visual representations of causal relationships among a set of variables.
> *   **Directed:** Edges have arrows ($A \to B$ means A causes B).
> *   **Acyclic:** No loops (You cannot go from A back to A).

## Purpose
DAGs help in identifying confounders, colliders, and the necessary adjustments for estimating causal effects.
