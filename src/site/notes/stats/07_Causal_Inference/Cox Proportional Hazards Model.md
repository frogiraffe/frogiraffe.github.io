## Definition

> [!abstract] Overview
> The **Cox Proportional Hazards Model** is a regression model that relates the time that passes before some event occurs to one or more predictor variables. It assumes that the effect of different variables on the hazard rate is multiplicative and does not change over time (proportional hazards assumption).
