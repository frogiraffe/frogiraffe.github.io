## Definition

> [!abstract] Overview
> **Isolation Forest** is an anomaly detection algorithm that isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. Anomalies are isolated closer to the root of the tree (shorter path lengths) than normal points.
