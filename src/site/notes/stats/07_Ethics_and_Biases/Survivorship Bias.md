# Survivorship Bias

## Definition

> [!abstract] Core Statement
> **Survivorship Bias** is the logical error of focusing on the people or things that "survived" some process and ignoring those that did not because of lack of visibility. This leads to **false conclusions** because the sample is not representative of the whole population.

---

## Purpose

1.  **Correct decision making:** Avoid optimizing for the wrong traits.
2.  **Investment analysis:** Mutual fund performance looks better than it is because failed funds vanish.
3.  **Startup/Success advice:** "I dropped out of college and succeeded" ignores the millions who dropped out and failed.

## The Classic Example: WWII Planes

> [!example] Abraham Wald & The Bullet Holes
> **Scenario:** The military analyzed planes returning from battle.
> **Data:** Most bullet holes were found on the **Wings** and **Tail**.
> **Military's Plan:** "Put more armor on the Wings and Tail!"
> 
> **Wald's Insight:**
> -   The planes you are looking at **Returned**. They survived.
> -   This means bullet holes in wings/tail are **survivable**.
> -   The planes that were hit in the **Engine** or **Cockpit**... **never came back**.
> 
> **Conclusion:** Armor the area where there are *no* bullet holes (the Engine). The missing data tells the story.

## Common Scenarios

| Context | Bias | Resulting Fallacy |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **Finance** | Analyzing indices (S&P 500) | "Stocks always go up" (You ignored Enron, Lehman Bros which were delisted). |
| **History** | "They don't make them like they used to" | You only see the old buildings that *survived*. The cheap ones collapsed long ago. |
| **Business** | "Do what Bill Gates did" | Ignores the luck factor and the silent graveyard of failed startups. |

## How to Detect & Mitigation

> [!check] Checklist
> 1.  **Where are the failures?** Am I seeing the full dataset or just the winners?
> 2.  **Is the data censored?** (e.g., Customer surveys only reach *current* customers, not those who churned in anger).
> 3.  **Look for the invisible:** Ask "Who is missing from this room?"
